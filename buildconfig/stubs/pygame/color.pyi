class Color(Collection[int]):
    """Pygame object for color representations.

    The ``Color`` class represents ``RGBA`` color values using a value range of
    0 to 255 inclusive. It allows basic arithmetic operations — binary
    operations ``+``, ``-``, ``*``, ``//``, ``%``, and unary operation ``~`` — to
    create new colors, supports conversions to other color spaces such as ``HSV``
    or ``HSL`` and lets you adjust single color channels.
    Alpha defaults to 255 (fully opaque) when not given.
    The arithmetic operations and ``correct_gamma()`` method preserve subclasses.
    For the binary operators, the class of the returned color is that of the
    left hand color object of the operator.

    Color objects support swizzling for their ``RGBA`` attributes, which allows
    the creation of new color objects with the corresponding swizzled attributes
    as its ``RGBA`` attributes. For example, ``color.bgra`` provides a shortcut to
    doing ``Color(color.b, color.g, color.r, color.a)``. Swizzling with other than
    4 attributes will return a tuple consisting of the corresponding elements
    instead of a color object.

    Color objects support equality comparison with other color objects and 3 or
    4 element tuples of integers. There was a bug in pygame 1.8.1
    where the default alpha was 0, not 255 like previously.

    Color objects export the C level array interface. The interface exports a
    read-only one dimensional unsigned byte array of the same assigned length
    as the color. The new buffer interface is also exported, with the same
    characteristics as the array interface.

    The floor division, ``//``, and modulus, ``%``, operators do not raise
    an exception for division by zero. Instead, if a color, or alpha, channel
    in the right hand color is 0, then the result is 0. For example: ::

        # These expressions are True
        Color(255, 255, 255, 255) // Color(0, 64, 64, 64) == Color(0, 3, 3, 3)
        Color(255, 255, 255, 255) % Color(64, 64, 64, 0) == Color(63, 63, 63, 0)

    Use ``int(color)`` to return the immutable integer value of the color,
    usable as a ``dict`` key. This integer value differs from the mapped
    pixel values of :meth:`pygame.Surface.get_at_mapped`,
    :meth:`pygame.Surface.map_rgb` and :meth:`pygame.Surface.unmap_rgb`.
    It can be passed as a ``color_value`` argument to :class:`Color`
    (useful with sets).

    See :doc:`color_list` for samples of the available named colors.

    :param int r: red value in the range of 0 to 255 inclusive
    :param int g: green value in the range of 0 to 255 inclusive
    :param int b: blue value in the range of 0 to 255 inclusive
    :param int a: (optional) alpha value in the range of 0 to 255 inclusive,
       default is 255
    :param color_value: color value (see note below for the supported formats)

        .. note::
            Supported ``color_value`` formats:
                | - **Color object:** clones the given :class:`Color` object
                | - **Color name: str:** name of the color to use, e.g. ``'red'``
                    (all the supported name strings can be found in the
                    :doc:`color_list`, with sample swatches)
                | - **HTML color format str:** ``'#rrggbbaa'`` or ``'#rrggbb'``,
                    where rr, gg, bb, and aa are 2-digit hex numbers in the range
                    of 0 to 0xFF inclusive, the aa (alpha) value defaults to 0xFF
                    if not provided
                | - **hex number str:** ``'0xrrggbbaa'`` or ``'0xrrggbb'``, where
                    rr, gg, bb, and aa are 2-digit hex numbers in the range of 0x00
                    to 0xFF inclusive, the aa (alpha) value defaults to 0xFF if not
                    provided
                | - **int:** int value of the color to use, using hex numbers can
                    make this parameter more readable, e.g. ``0xrrggbbaa``, where rr,
                    gg, bb, and aa are 2-digit hex numbers in the range of 0x00 to
                    0xFF inclusive, note that the aa (alpha) value is not optional for
                    the int format and must be provided
                | - **tuple/list of int color values:** ``(R, G, B, A)`` or
                    ``(R, G, B)``, where R, G, B, and A are int values in the range of
                    0 to 255 inclusive, the A (alpha) value defaults to 255 if not
                    provided
