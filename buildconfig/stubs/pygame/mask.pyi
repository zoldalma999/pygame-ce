class Mask:
    """Pygame object for representing 2D bitmasks.

    A ``Mask`` object is used to represent a 2D bitmask. Each bit in
    the mask represents a pixel. 1 is used to indicate a set bit and 0 is used
    to indicate an unset bit. Set bits in a mask can be used to detect collisions
    with other masks and their set bits.

    A filled mask has all of its bits set to 1, conversely an
    unfilled/cleared/empty mask has all of its bits set to 0. Masks can be
    created unfilled (default) or filled by using the ``fill`` parameter. Masks
    can also be cleared or filled using the :func:`pygame.mask.Mask.clear()` and
    :func:`pygame.mask.Mask.fill()` methods respectively.

    A mask's coordinates start in the top left corner at ``(0, 0)`` just like
    :mod:`pygame.Surface`. Individual bits can be accessed using the
    :func:`pygame.mask.Mask.get_at()` and :func:`pygame.mask.Mask.set_at()`

    mask's top left corner. The calling mask's top left corner is considered to

        :param setcolor: (optional) color to draw set bits (default is
            ``(255, 255, 255, 255)``, white), use ``None`` to skip drawing the set
            bits, the ``setsurface`` parameter (if set) will takes precedence over
            this parameter
        :type setcolor: :data:`pygame.typing.ColorLike` or ``None``
        :param unsetcolor: (optional) color to draw unset bits (default is
            ``(0, 0, 0, 255)``, black), use ``None`` to skip drawing the unset
            bits, the ``unsetsurface`` parameter (if set) will takes precedence
            over this parameter
        :type unsetcolor: :data:`pygame.typing.ColorLike` or ``None``
        :param dest: (optional) surface destination of where to position the
            topleft corner of the mask being drawn (default is ``(0, 0)``), if a
            Rect is used as the ``dest`` parameter, its ``x`` and ``y`` attributes
            will be used as the destination, **NOTE1:** rects with a negative width
            or height value will not be normalized before using their ``x`` and
            ``y`` values, **NOTE2:** this destination value is only used to
            position the mask on the surface, it does not offset the ``setsurface``
            and ``unsetsurface`` from the mask, they are always aligned with the
            mask (i.e. position ``(0, 0)`` on the mask always corresponds to
            position ``(0, 0)`` on the ``setsurface`` and ``unsetsurface``)
        :type dest: Rect or tuple(int, int) or list(int, int) or Vector2(int, int)
        :param area: (optional) rectangular portion of the mask to draw. It can be a
            rect-like object (a Rect, a tuple or a list with 4 numbers or an object with a
            rect attribute, etc) or it can be None (the default) in which case it will use the
            entire mask. If the given rect pertrudes outside the bounds of the mask (as returned
            by :meth:`get_rect`), it will get clipped to fit those boundaries. If the final rect
            is smaller than the mask and no destination ``surface`` is given, the returned surface
            will have the same size as this final rect.
        :type area: Rect or rect-like object

        :returns: the ``surface`` parameter (or a newly created surface if no
            ``surface`` parameter was provided) with this mask drawn on it
        :rtype: Surface

        :raises ValueError: if the ``setsurface`` parameter or ``unsetsurface``
            parameter does not have the same format (bytesize/bitsize/alpha) as
            the ``surface`` parameter

        .. note ::
            To skip drawing the set bits, both ``setsurface`` and ``setcolor`` must
            be ``None``. The ``setsurface`` parameter defaults to ``None``, but
            ``setcolor`` defaults to a color value and therefore must be set to
            ``None``.

        .. note ::
            To skip drawing the unset bits, both ``unsetsurface`` and
            ``unsetcolor`` must be ``None``. The ``unsetsurface`` parameter
            defaults to ``None``, but ``unsetcolor`` defaults to a color value and
            therefore must be set to ``None``.
